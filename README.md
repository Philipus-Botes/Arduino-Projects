# Arduino Projects

A collection of compact and experimental Arduino-based projects built using the **Arduino Uno** and a variety of sensors, modules, and components.

This repository serves as a personal sandbox for showcasing embedded systems knowledge, hardware prototyping, and interaction with real-world inputs/outputs with a focus on practical, well-documented code and component logic.

## About

These projects span topics such as:

- Physical access control and sensor-based security
- Interactive displays and input devices
- Timing-based logic and user feedback mechanisms
- Embedded system concepts including EEPROM usage, I2C communication, and digital I/O
- Small proof-of-concept builds inspired by real-world use cases or cybersecurity fundamentals

Each project resides in its own folder and includes:

- Arduino sketch (`.ino`) files with clear comments
- Brief documentation and circuit notes through a README.md file
- Code written with readability, modularity, and clarity in mind

## Skills Demonstrated

- Embedded C/C++ programming
- Digital & analog signal processing
- Button debouncing and timing logic
- Communication protocols (I2C, SPI, Serial)
- EEPROM read/write and state retention
- Real-time user interaction via buttons, displays, buzzers, etc.
- Hardware-level problem solving and prototyping

## Requirements

- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
- Standard components such as:
  - Pushbuttons, resistors, LEDs, buzzers
  - I2C LCDs, RFID modules, PIR sensors, etc.
- Arduino IDE with necessary libraries.
